1.2-alpha:

* ADDED: Custom vanilla ore variants - these can be silk touched for the Vanilla ores. All drop values are directly referenced from their vanilla variants
* ADDED: Assorted Quartz Clusters can drop Certus Quartz, Charged Certus Quartz or Black Quartz if available.
* ADDED: Ore Samples on the surface above where that type of ore will generate. Mining within the chunk you find one will lead you to a deposit.
* ADDED: Separate user entries in the config for custom "stones" / "rocks"
* CHANGED: Mineral deposits found below Y = 24 can contain pockets of magma
* CHANGED: Rarities - a lot - only one ore type can generate per chunk
* CHANGED: Cluster Sizes - since ores are rarer, these are much larger
* CHANGED: Stone variants have their own separate chances to spawn, preventing them taking an OreGen oppportunity
* CHANGED: Minor refactors to be more similar to vanilla
* FIXED: Config GUI not prompting user to restart their game
* FIXED: Various smelting recipe issues
* FIXED: Rocks replacing more valuable minerals

1.1-alpha:

* ADDED: User configurable plutons entries (ideal for mods that I didn't include)
* CHANGED: Vanilla ore gen weights. Most things are more rare, except the stone variants; those are more common
