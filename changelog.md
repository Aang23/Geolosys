1.1-alpha:

* ADDED: User configurable plutons entries (ideal for mods that I didn't include)
* CHANGED: Vanilla ore gen weights. Most things are more rare, except the stone variants; those are more common
* CHANGED: Default ore gen options. Materials with 2 variants are half as rare now.

1.0-alpha:

* Initial Release
