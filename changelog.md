1.3:
**Warning, this is basically the 'Samples' update :P**

* ADDED: Right click interaction to samples
* FIXED: Samples not always generating
* FIXED: Samples spawning in superflat
* FIXED: Unused config option for # of veins per chunk (obviously it's 1, always)
* CHANGED: Samples generate in clusters of 1 to 4
* CHANGED: Samples behave more realistically
* CHANGED: Tweaked vanilla ore-gen values one last time. 5/7 are balanced now ;)

1.2:

* ADDED: Custom vanilla ore variants - these can be silk touched for the Vanilla ores. All drop values are directly referenced from their vanilla variants
* ADDED: Assorted Quartz Clusters can drop Certus Quartz, Charged Certus Quartz or Black Quartz if available.
* ADDED: Ore Samples on the surface above where that type of ore will generate. Mining within the chunk you find one will lead you to a deposit.
* ADDED: Separate user entries in the config for custom "stones" / "rocks"
* CHANGED: Mineral deposits found below Y = 24 can contain pockets of magma
* CHANGED: Rarities - a lot - only one ore type can generate per chunk
* CHANGED: Cluster Sizes - since ores are rarer, these are much larger
* CHANGED: Stone variants have their own separate chances to spawn, preventing them taking an OreGen oppportunity
* CHANGED: Minor refactors to be more similar to vanilla
* FIXED: Config GUI not prompting user to restart their game
* FIXED: Various smelting recipe issues
* FIXED: Rocks replacing more valuable minerals

1.1-alpha:

* ADDED: User configurable plutons entries (ideal for mods that I didn't include)
* CHANGED: Vanilla ore gen weights. Most things are more rare, except the stone variants; those are more common
* CHANGED: Default ore gen options. Materials with 2 variants are half as rare now.

1.0-alpha:

* Initial Release
