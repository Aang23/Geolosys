So, since there has been some confusion regarding "how to find ores" and I've heard a lot of "there aren't ores here even though there's samples", I decided to make this tutorial to help.

To find a mineral deposit, start by finding an mineral sample on the surface, such as this one:

Once you have, start by determining the chunk borders. You can do this either via `F3 + G`, a minimap such as JourneyMap, or by simply playing it safe and going 16 blocks out in **each direction** from the sample to guarantee you've covered the entire chunk it's in.

After you've established your "borders", start in the middle(ish) of the chunk. By doing so, you guarantee the highest chance of running into it on your way down. You should refer to the [official wiki](https://oitsjustjose.github.io/Mods/geolosys.html) for what heights certain minerals. Upon determining the Y-level which you seek, I suggest digging down to the **highest Y-level it the deposit can form at**, start branching towards your four borders, and then dig down another few blocks and repeat.

If you still cannot find it, try the four corners first - **digging out the entire chunk should be a last resort and completely unnecessary**.

See? It's right there in the **same chunk** as the sample was! Now - that's not to say it was directly above (as in this photo, where it was on the opposite corner of the chunk), so don't be mistaken!
